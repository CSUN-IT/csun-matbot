# Mat Bot

> Front end component of the AI JAM 2024 winner implementation

## Pre-requisites

This is a React application which requires Node.js be installed on the machine. For local development and testing, the best approach for this is to install `nvm` and be able to switch Node versions quickly. 

## Starting up

To start a development server do the following steps on your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CSUN-IT/csun-matbot.git
cd csun-matbot
nvm install
nvm use
npm install
npm run start
```
